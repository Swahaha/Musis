# Musis - Optical Music Recognition Interface

As someone who enjoys music production, I wanted a quick and easy way to convert sheet music into editable formats like MusicXML or MIDI — something I could plug into my DAW and mess around with. 

But I couldn’t find a free and reliable solution out there.

Musis is built to fix that.

It’s an open-source tool that makes it easy to upload scanned sheet music and get structured, editable output.

Stay tuned :)
